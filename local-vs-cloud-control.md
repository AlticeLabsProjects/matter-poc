## Local control vs Cloud control

PROS

- more privacy friendly (personal data not transferred to Cloud)
- responsive system with lower latency in devices communication
- more resilient to Internet access problems
- simpler arch:
  - more agile to evolve
  - easier to debug 
- lower impact of failures (locally) e.g. if scheduller fails it only impacts a single home
- Better SLAs
- Future proof / longevity: the system is owned by the user and should still work without the service provider
- More secure (?)
- less cloud resources spent

CONS

- more resources spent locally, more expensive controllers
- AI based intelligence needs lots of computing resources
